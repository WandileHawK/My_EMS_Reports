    "I hope you had a wonderful time during the holiday break. In today's lecture, we will revisit the problem on sum of squares of integers, which we began to explore just before the holiday break. The problems is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Given that $a$ and $b$ are integers, what integers $n$ can be written in the form $n=a^2+b^2$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a cases that do and do not work.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * $2 = 1^2+1^2$ works;\n",
    "   * $3$ does not work, since we only allow integers.  $1+1$ is too small, $1^2+2^2=5$ is too big;\n",
    "   * $4$ actually <em>does</em> work, because we allow $4 = 0^2+2^2$.  (That's just one of our rules; you could play a different game if you wanted.);\n",
    "   * That means $1=1^2+0^2$ works.\n",
    "   * $5$ works.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so forth. In our last lecture, we were able to pose the following questions relating to the sum of squares: \n",
    "\n",
    "   * Which positive integers can be written as a sum of two squares?\n",
    "   * Which ones cannot?\n",
    "   * Which positive integers can be written as a sum of squares of it factors?\n",
    "   * Can there be a formula for expressing $n$ as the sum of two positive square numbers? \n",
    "   * Which numbers can be written as a sum of squares of 2 prime numbers?\n",
    "   * These numbers that can be written as a sum of two squares, are they odd or even? \n",
    "   * Is the sum of squares even or odd?\n",
    "   * Given $a$ and $b$ are prime, is the sum of their squares, $a^{2}+b^{2}$ prime?\n",
    "   * Can the square roots of numbers be written in any other form aside from $x^{2} + 0^{2}$? \n",
    "   * Is there more than one way to get the $n$, and if they is, what's the relationship between the $a$, $b$ and $n$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "In our last lecture, we started by first tried working with pens and paper. We tried by listing those positive integers $n$ ranging from $1$ to $50$ that can be written as a sum of squares and those that can not be written.  \n",
